#' Weigted Voting Method (WVM)
#'
#' Ranking rule
#' 
#' 
#' This procedure is based on the proportion of victories/defeats of each couple 
#' of candidates. It candidate receives a score resulting of the aggregation of 
#' all the proportions of victories and ranks the candidates according to this score.
#' We consider the matrix \eqn{P} of proportions of victories/defeats where \eqn{P_{ij}} is 
#' the proportion of times that candidate \eqn{c_i} is preferred to candidate \eqn{c_j}{cj}, 
#' for any \eqn{i != j}{ij}, and \eqn{P_{ii} = 0.5}. The victories and the defeats are separated 
#' in two matrices \eqn{P^+}  and \eqn{P^âˆ’}
#' 
#' t must be remarked that this method comes from the field of group decision making [33].
